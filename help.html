          <h2>What is Join?</h2>
          <p>
            <span>Join</span>
            is a kanban-based project management tool designed and built by a group of dedicated
            students as part of their web development bootcamp at the Developer Akademie.
            <br />
            <br />
            Kanban, a Japanese term meaning "billboard", is a highly effective method to visualize
            work, limit work-in-progress, and maximize efficiency (or flow).
            <span>Join</span>
            leverages the principles of kanban to help users manage their tasks and projects in an
            intuitive, visual interface.
            <br />
            <br />
            It is important to note that
            <span>Join</span>
            is designed as an educational exercise and is not intended for extensive business usage.

        <h2>How to use it</h2>
        <p>
          Here is a step-by-step guide on how to use
          <span>Join</span>:
        </p>
        <div class="help-list">
          <ol type="1">
            <li>
              <h3>Exploring the Board</h3>
              <p>
                When you log in to
                <span>Join</span>
                , you'll find a default board. This board represents your project and contains four
                default lists: "To Do", "In Progress", “Await feedback” and "Done".
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Creating Contacts</h3>
              <p>
                In
                <span>Join</span>, you can add contacts to collaborate on your projects. Go to the "Contacts" section,
                click on "New contact", and fill in the required information. Once added, these
                contacts can be assigned tasks and they can interact with the tasks on the board.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Adding Cards</h3>
              <p>
                Now that you've added your contacts, you can start adding cards. Cards represent
                individual tasks. Click the "+" button under the appropriate list to create a new
                card. Fill in the task details in the card, like task name, description, due date,
                assignees, etc.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Moving Cards</h3>
              <p>
                As the task moves from one stage to another, you can reflect that on the board by
                dragging and dropping the card from one list to another.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Deleting Cards</h3>
              <p>
                Once a task is completed, you can either move it to the "Done" list or delete it.
                Deleting a card will permanently remove it from the board. Please exercise caution
                when deleting cards, as this action is irreversible.
              </p>
            </li>

            Remember that using
            <span>Join</span>
            effectively requires consistent updates from you and your team to ensure the board
            reflects the current state of your project.
