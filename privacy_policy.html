            <h3>Nature and purpose of the processing:</h3>
            <p>
                When you access our website, i.e., if you do not register or otherwise provide information, general information of a non-personal nature is automatically recorded. This information (server log files) includes, for example, the type of web browser, the operating system used, the domain name of your Internet service provider, your IP address, and similar details. 
            </p>
            <p>They are processed, in particular, for the following purposes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Ensuring a smooth connection setup of the website,
                </li>
                <li>
                    Ensuring smooth use of our website,
                </li>
                <li>
                    Evaluating system security and stability as well as
                </li>
                <li>
                    optimizing our website.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                We do not use your data to draw conclusions about your person. Information of this kind is possibly statistically evaluated by us in anonymized form to optimize our online presence and the underlying technology. 
            </p>
            <h3>Legal basis and legitimate interest:</h3>
            <p>
                The processing is carried out in accordance with Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR based on our legitimate interest in improving the stability and functionality of our website.

            <h3>Recipients:</h3>
            <p>
                Recipients of the data may be technical service providers who act as data processors for the operation and maintenance of our website.

            <h3>Storage duration:</h3>
            <p>
                The data will be deleted as soon as it is no longer necessary for the purpose of collection. For data used to provide the website, this is generally the case when the respective session is terminated. 
            </p>
            <p> 
                In the case of storing data in log files, this occurs no later than 14 days. Extended storage is possible. In this case, the IP addresses of users are anonymized, making it no longer possible to associate the calling client.
            </p>
            <h3>Provision required or necessary:</h3>
            <p>
                The provision of the aforementioned personal data is neither legally nor contractually required. However, without the IP address, the service and functionality of our website cannot be guaranteed. In addition, individual services and features may not be available or may be restricted. Therefore, objection is excluded.
